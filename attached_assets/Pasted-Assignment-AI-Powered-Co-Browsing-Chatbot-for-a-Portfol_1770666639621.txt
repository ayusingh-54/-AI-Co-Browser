Assignment: AI-Powered Co-Browsing
Chatbot for a Portfolio Website

Objective
Build a conversational AI chatbot that can act as a co-browsing assistant for a portfolio
website.
The chatbot should dynamically understand the website’s content and help users explore it by
answering questions and performing actions like navigation, scrolling, clicking, highlighting
elements, and filling inputs — all without hard-coded content.
The project must be built using React , leverage the openai API, and be fully 
deployed with a live demo.

Key Requirements
1. Website & Content Handling
● You may use any portfolio website (personal portfolio, sample portfolio, or your own).
● The chatbot must dynamically extract content from the website:

Example user query:
● “What projects are showcased here?”
Agent Reasoning:
● Extract visible text from the Projects section
● Summarize project titles and descriptions
● Answer conversationally

2. Conversational AI Agent
● Use open ai  API as the AI engine. 
● The chatbot should:
○ Maintain conversational context
○ Ask clarifying questions when needed
○ Respond naturally and conversationally

3. Co-Browsing Capabilities (Core Feature)
The chatbot should act as a co-browsing agent, capable of performing actions on the website
using tool calls:
Required Actions:
● Scroll up/down
● Navigate to sections/pages
● Click buttons or links
● Highlight elements on the page
● Input data into forms (e.g., contact form)
● Focus or zoom into specific sections
It’s fine if you don’t perform all the above mentioned actions.
These actions should be triggered by user intent, not buttons.
Example:
User: “Go to the projects section and highlight the most recent one.
Reference: sample.mp4

4. Frontend & Architecture
● Framework: React ## use only rect and javascript and tailwind for css  
● Clean component structure and readable code

5. Tool Calling & Automation
● Implement a tool-based action system where the AI:
○ Decides what action to take
○ Calls a corresponding function

The AI should not directly manipulate the DOM — it should request tools that do.
6. Deployment
● Deploy the application on Vercel
● The deployed app must:
○ Be publicly accessible
○ Work end-to-end (chat + co-browsing)



8. Working Demo
● Provide a working video that demonstrates:
○ Conversational Q&A
○ Website understanding
○ Co-browsing actions
○ Tool-based interactions

● The video should clearly show:
○ User prompt
○ AI response
○ Corresponding on-page action
