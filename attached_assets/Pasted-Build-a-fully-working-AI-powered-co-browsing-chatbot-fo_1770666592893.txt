Build a fully working AI-powered co-browsing chatbot for a portfolio website using React + JavaScript + Tailwind CSS and OpenAI API, deployed on Vercel, with tool-based co-browsing actions (scroll, navigate, highlight, click, input).

The chatbot must dynamically understand website content (NO hard-coded portfolio data) and act as a co-browsing assistant.

🧱 Tech Stack (STRICT)

Frontend: React (JavaScript only)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

AI: OpenAI API

Deployment: Vercel

No backend framework required (use API routes or serverless functions if needed)

🌐 Portfolio Website Requirements

Build a sample portfolio website with sections:

Hero / About

Skills

Projects (at least 3 projects)

Experience

Contact form

Each section must have:

Unique IDs

Semantic HTML

NO project data hard-coded into the chatbot

Chatbot must extract content directly from the DOM

🤖 Chatbot Core Features
1️⃣ Conversational AI

Use OpenAI API

Maintain conversation history

Ask clarifying questions if intent is unclear

Respond in natural human language

2️⃣ Dynamic Website Understanding

Implement a DOM extractor that:

Reads visible text only

Groups content by section

Sends extracted content to the LLM when answering questions

Example:
User:

“What projects are showcased here?”

AI flow:

Extract DOM text from #projects

Summarize titles + descriptions

Respond conversationally

3️⃣ Tool-Based Co-Browsing (CORE FEATURE)

❗ The AI must NOT manipulate the DOM directly

Instead:

AI decides the action

AI calls a tool

Tool executes the DOM operation

🔧 Required Tools (Implement as Functions)

Define tools like this:

{
  name: "scroll",
  description: "Scrolls the page",
  parameters: { direction: "up | down" }
}

Tools to implement:

scroll(direction)

navigateTo(sectionId)

highlightElement(selector)

clickElement(selector)

inputText(selector, text)

focusSection(sectionId)

🧠 Tool Calling Flow

User message

Send message + DOM context to OpenAI

Model decides:

Response text

Tool call (if needed)

Tool executes action

UI reflects action visually

🖌️ Visual Feedback

Highlight elements with animated borders

Smooth scrolling

Clear visual focus when navigating sections

💬 Chat UI

Floating chat widget (bottom-right)

Messages:

User bubble

AI bubble

Show:

AI text

Triggered action clearly

🚀 Deployment

Deploy frontend on Vercel

Use environment variables:

VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here


App must work end-to-end after deployment
